# Final-Project
Final Project for info 201 spring 2018

## Project Description
  The data set that we will be using is the Seattle pet license data set on kaggle.  The data set was created by Rachael Tatman, Ali l. Tayih, and Omar Shandaq.  The data set includes data about the pet licenses issued by the Seattle Animal Shelter between the 2005 and 2017.  The data set also includes Tax returns by income bracket and what animals they received licenses for.

  The target audience is primarily people interested in animal adoptions and how finances play into the choices people make about what animal to adopt.

  Audiences can hope to learn about how finances effect decisions in pet adoptions, what animals are most adopted and which are least adopted in the Seattle area, and the correlations between tax bracket and the animal adopted.

## Technical Description
  The data will be read in with via the read.csv function in R.  The pet license data will need to be joined with the tax returns by income bracket data.  This project will rely on the common libraries used and taught in the course.  We anticipate creating the plotly interactive map to be the most difficult, however we all have very limited coding experience and the shiny webpage looks like it might cause lots of problems.
