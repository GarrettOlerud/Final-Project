# Here is where we can post general ideas for our project, assign tasks, and establish/reference timelines

__Website Section Ideas__  (also include the questions being asked/intended outcome
for the reader):

* Heat maps (2) __Garrett__
  * One map of pet adoption rates in WA based on lat/long (pulled from zipcode package)
  * Another map of income (may use lat/long if possible/relevant)
  * Look into a package that can take in zipcodes and return the respective counties

* Max/Min Adoption by location
 * What zip codes have the highest vs. lowest adoption rates?
 * Display with an interactive map
 * Possible include an interactive feature to also show income or tax bracket

* Most popular breeds __Spencer__
 * most popular breeds for dogs and cats (could be one or two visualizations)
